     <h3>Step 1: Configure packaged software</h3>
     I used these free tools:
     <ul>
       <li><a href="http://opendatakit.org/use/collect/">ODK
       Collect</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate/">ODK
       Aggregate</a></li>      
       <li><a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App
       Engine</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://www.google.com/google-d-s/spreadsheets/">Google
       Spreadsheets</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Google
       Android SDK</a></li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Step 2: Build an XForms file for each EGRA component</h3>
     <p>A complete EGRA instrument could be built and tested in a
     single <a href="http://code.javarosa.org/wiki/xform">JavaRosa XForms</a> file, but I found it easiest to build and
     test files for each EGRA component separately, and then later
     combine the individual components into a single file.</p>

     <p>For simple EGRA components, <a href="http://opendatakit.org/use/build/">ODK Build</a> can be used to generate
     XForms XML. For more complex forms, build the forms manually
     (with the help of
     some <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>
     macros and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script">shell scripts</a>).</p>

     <p>I built individual XForms files for each of the eight
     components of the sample EGRA instrument in the <a href="https://www.eddataglobal.org/documents/index.cfm?fuseaction=pubDetail&ID=149">English EGRA Toolkit.</a></p>

       <ul>
	 <li>Component 0: Student Information
	   [ <a href="../videos/c0.swf">demo</a> ]
	   [ <a href="../code/xml/C0_StudentInformation.xml">.xml</a> ]</li>
	 <li>Component 1: Letter Name Knowledge
	   [ <a href="../videos/c1.swf">demo</a> ]
	   [ <a href="../code/xml/C1_LetterNameKnowledge.xml">.xml</a> ]</li>
	 <li>Component 2a: Phonemic Awareness
	   [ <a href="../videos/c2a.swf">demo</a> ]
	   [ <a href="../code/xml/C2a_PhonemicAwareness.xml">.xml</a> ]</li>
	 <li>Component 2b: Initial Sound Identification
	   [ <a href="../videos/c2b.swf">demo</a> ]
	   [ <a href="../code/xml/C2b_PhonemicAwarenessISI.xml">.xml</a> ]</li>
	 <li>Component 3: Letter Sound Knowledge
	   [ <a href="../videos/c3.swf">demo</a> ]
	   [ <a href="../code/xml/C3_LetterSoundKnowledge.xml">.xml</a> ]</li>
	 <li>Component 4: Familiar Word Reading
	   [ <a href="../videos/c4.swf">demo</a> ]
	   [ <a href="../code/xml/C4_FamiliarWordReading.xml">.xml</a> ]</li>
	 <li>Component 5: Unfamiliar Nonword Decoding
	   [ <a href="../code/xml/C5_UnfamiliarNonwordDecoding.xml">.xml</a>
	   ]</li>
	 <li>Component 6: Passage Reading and Comprehension
	   [ <a href="../videos/c6.swf">demo</a> ]
	   [ <a href="../code/xml/C6_PassageReadingAndComprehension.xml">.xml</a>
	   ]</li>
	 <li>Component 7: Listening Comprehension
	   [ <a href="../videos/c7.swf">demo</a> ]
	   [ <a href="../code/xml/C7_ListeningComprehension.xml">.xml</a>
	   ]</li>
	 <li>Component 8: Dictation [ <a href="../code/xml/C8_Dictation.xml">
	 .xml </a> ] </li>
       </ul>

     <p>I used shell scripts to help generate XML code. <a href="../code/shell/updateLetters.sh">updateLetters.sh</a> is script
       that updates the letters in the Letter Name Knowledge XML file,
       taking as input a file containing 100 letters separated by spaces
       and the XForms file for component one. Such scripts allow the
       same XML source code to be used in multiple ICT4EGRA
       deployments by making the source code easily modifiable.</p>

     <p>XForms files can be validated using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/wiki/ODKValidate">ODK Validate</a> and tested locally on
       an <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/devices/index.html">Android virtual device.</a></p>

     <p>The final component, dictation, requires the student to listen to a
       series of words spoken aloud by the evaluator and write down
       what he or she hears. Since the results for this component are
       recorded on the student sheet rather than in the evaluator
       sheet, the XForms file prompts the evaluator to take a picture
       of the student response form using the mobile phone's
       camera. The picture can be uploaded to the server with the rest
       of the EGRA results and analyzed after the teams return from
       the field, saving data entry time while at the schools
       themselves.</p>

     <p>I also built a short XForms survey which prompts the evaluator
     to enter the
       student's ID number (if any), last name, first name,
       gender, and grade level. This information will link EGRA
       results to individual students and hopefully allow teachers
       and evaluators to better track and improve individual-level
       learning outcomes.</p>
     <h3>Step 3: Combine the XForms files for each component into a
     single file</h3>
     <p>The shell script <a href="../code/shell/addComponents.sh">addComponents.sh</a> automates the combination
     process: it takes as input an EGRA survey template file
     (<a href="../code/xml/EGRA_template.xml">EGRA_template.xml</a>) and multiple component XForms files. It then adds the
     code from the component XForms files to the template file to
     create a single XForms file with all components. This script
     allows you to pick and choose which components to include in
     the EGRA instrument.
     <p>I built two final XForms files: <a href="../code/xml/EGRA_C1toC7.xml">EGRA_C1toC7.xml</a> (with
     components 1 to 7) and <a href="../code/xml/EGRA_C8.xml">EGRA_C8.xml</a> (with component 8). Component
     eight requires the evaluator to take a picture using the mobile
     phone, and the camera software on Android is buggy. In testing,
     component 8 would cause ODK Collect to crash, losing the data
     collected from the first seven components. To isolate the effects
     of this type of crash, components one to seven are administered
     separately from component eight.</p>
     <h3>Step 4: Send the XForms file to ODK Aggregate and ODK
     Collect</h3>
     <p>Once the XForms file is complete, ODK will take of most of the
     technical work of capturing, storing, aggregating, and displaying
     the data.</p>
     <p>To enter the XForms file into the ODK system, upload
     the final .xml file to ODK Aggregate using its web
     interface. Then, from an ODK Collect instance on an Android
     device, select "Manage Forms And Data" and
     "Get New Forms" ODK Collect will find the XForms
     file on ODK Aggregate and download it to the phone. Here's a <a href="../videos/Step4.swf">video demonstration</a>.</p> </p>
     <h3>Step 5: Administer the assessment using ODK Collect</h3>
     <p>Many phones can capture data for the same XForms file, so many
     evaluators can use the system simultaneously. Results are stored
     locally on the phone in an XML after the test is
     administered. Each student's results are saved on the
     phone's local memory by ODK Collect as separate results
     files. Here's a <a href="../videos/Step5.swf">video
     demonstration</a>.</p> 
     <h3>Step 6: Send results from the phones to the server</h3>
     <p>Results can be sent from the phone to the server either over a
     3G mobile connection or through a wireless LAN connection. This
     is an out-of-the-box ODK Collect feature. Results could also be
     copied from the phone to a computer and then uploaded to the
     server through the ODK Aggregate web interface. Here's a <a href="../videos/Step6.swf">video demonstration</a>.</p>
     <h3>Step 7: Download and analyze the results</h3>
     <p>The ODK Aggregate web interface allows users to view gathered
     data online and download results in a comma-separated values
     (.csv) file. This file format is standard so the results can be
     analyzed using any common statistics software. For demonstration,
     the author wrote a Google App Script function <a href="../code/gas/analyzeEGRAResults.txt">analyzeEGRAResults()</a>
     for Google Spreadsheets to parse raw data, compute scores for
     each component, and calculate averages across students for each
     of the scores. Here's a <a href="../videos/Step7.swf">video demonstration</a>.</p>
