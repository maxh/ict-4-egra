This web page presents a fully functional Android-based system for
literacy data collection.

The Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) is an education evaluation
instrument used to measure student literacy in developing countries.
The test is administered by trained enumerators who assess samples
of students at multiple schools. Results are currently recorded on
paper and then manually digitized when enumerators return from
fieldwork. With the ICT system introduced here, results would instead
be recorded on mobile phones and transmitted over the Internet. The
system relies heavily on Open Data Kit, a set of open-source software
for mobile data collection, storage, and aggregation. The results
are analyzed online with Google Apps Script.
