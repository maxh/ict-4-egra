A fully functional system for literacy data collection.

The Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) is a test used to measure 
student literacy in developing countries. It's administered by 
trained testers who assess batches of students at multiple schools.
Results are currently recorded on paper and then manually digitized
when testers return from fieldwork. 

With the ICT system introduced here, results can be recorded on
mobile phones and transmitted over the Internet. It's built with
Open Data Kit and Google Apps Script.
